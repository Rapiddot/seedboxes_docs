# How to change your torrent client

During the order of your seedbox, you were asked which client you prefer as your default. However, if you ever change your mind in the future, it is simple to change your torrent client.

:::info
Each seedbox can only have only 1 torrent client running at any time. This is to allocate a fair share of resources for each user on the server.

The procedure is fairly simple:

* Login to your [client area](https://seedboxes.cc/client/dashboard).
After you log in to your seedbox account, click in the **"My Client Area"** button.

* You will receive a confirmation that your client has been changed. Please allow 1-2 minutes for the change to propagate to your server. Afterwards, you can click at the **"Torrent Client info"** button to check information regarding your torrent client or just hit the **"Go to Torrent client"** button to visit the torrent client's web UI
