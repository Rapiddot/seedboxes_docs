Seedboxes.cc supports **TOTP (Time based One Time Password) two factor authentication** for your account via *Google Authenticator*. If you enable this option in your account, every time that you login into your client area, you will required to enter a one time password generated by the google authenticator application installed on your smartphone. So in order to have two factor authentication enabled with your account, a smartphone or tablet (ios or android) is required in order for this to work.

The steps to enable it in your account are as follows:

1) Install the Google Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet

**Android**: [Link at Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)

**IOS**: [Link at AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/gr/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)

Set the current two factor authentication **status** as: **ON**

Then **type the current one time password** you see on your phone in the input box, and then click **SUBMIT**

If you did all that correctly, you will receive a success message that your two factor authentication is now **ENABLED** for your account.

*If you wish to disable it ever again in the future, you can go back to this page in your client area, and set the status to OFF.*

5) From now on, every time that you login, you will be presented with the following screen that will ask you to verify the one time password from your google authenticator app:
