# Refund Policy

All new customers are entitled to our 7 days money back guarantee. This means that if you want to cancel your seedbox, for any reason, within the first 7 days of your purchase, we will charge you only for the first week of the service (or for the percentage of bandwidth used, whichever is bigger) and refund the rest. No questions asked!

In order to make use of this, you will have to send us an email to **sales@seedboxes.cc** or open a ticket with the sales department. Your seedbox will be cancelled as soon as we receive your request and your money refunded.
