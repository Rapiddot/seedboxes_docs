# Are public trackers allowed ?

Public trackers are allowed but are definitely not recommended.

The reason is that public trackers are highly unreliable. They are very often down, causing slowdowns to your seedbox, and download speeds are lower too.

Also, if you care about your privacy, public trackers are often illegally monitored by many antipiracy organizations and should be avoided if possible.
