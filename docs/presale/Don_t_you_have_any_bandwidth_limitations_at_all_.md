# Are there any bandwidth speed limitations?

Each server comes with a 20Gbit dedicated line. This guarantees, that any user on the server will never be limited because of the activity of another user. There will never be a network bottleneck.

Each plan has a monthly upload traffic quota. Download traffic is unmetered. When you go over your allowed upload traffic quota, the upload speed will be limited to 1-5Mbit, but you will not be charged extra for any additional upload traffic you generate.
