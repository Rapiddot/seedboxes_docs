# Are there any bandwidth speed limitations?

Each server comes with a 20Gbit dedicated line. This guarantees, that any user on the server will never be limited because of the activity of another user. There will never be a network bottleneck.

Have in mind that the 20gbit speed is refered to the total available network speed of the server, which is shared amond the users of that server. It is practically impossible for a single account to reach this speed, as no hard disk can read/write that fast. 

So we merely state, that your only bottleneck and technical limitation will be the speed of your disk, and not the network activity of another user.
