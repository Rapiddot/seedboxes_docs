# Are there any bandwidth speed limitations?

Each server comes with a 50Gbit symmetrical dedicated line. This guarantees, that any user on the server will never be limited because of the activity of another user. There will never be a network bottleneck.

Have in mind that the 50gbit speed is refered to the total available network speed of the server, which is shared amond the users of that server. It is practically impossible for a single account to reach this speed, as no hard disk can read/write that fast. 

So we merely state, that your only bottleneck and technical limitation will be the speed of your disk, and not the network activity of another user.

## What about upload traffic quotas ?

Each plan comes with a monthly traffic quota. This refers ONLY to upload traffic from your seedbox. Download on your seedbox is always unmetered and unlimited. This quota resets every month, on your plan monthly renewal date. If this quota is exceeded within the monthly cycle, then your account's upload speed will be limited to 10Mbit/sec and will remain unlimited afterwards in this speed. Once your quota resets at the beginning of your next monthly cycle, the speed will return back to normal.
