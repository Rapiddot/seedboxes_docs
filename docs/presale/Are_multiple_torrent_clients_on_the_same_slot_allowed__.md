# Are multiple torrent clients allowed on the same seedbox ?

We do not allow running multiple instances of torrent clients on each slot. Each slot is entitled on running a single torrent client (rtorrent, deluge or transmission).

Running multiple torrent clients in the same slot, is an unfair use of resources against the other users of the same server and most importantly the other users on the same disk. In order to keep performance in high levels it is necessary for all users to be fair on the resources of the server they use.

The only exception would be the Red Dragon Box with the dedicated disk. In this case, we might allow a second torrent client running, because this slot does not share any resources with other users on the same disk. Even in this case though, it is necessary to contact our support to make this request.
