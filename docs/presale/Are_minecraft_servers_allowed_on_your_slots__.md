# Are Minecraft servers allowed on your slots

Minecraft servers are not allowed running on our slots. This also includes any other game server or application server that requires an increased amount of resources and has an increased risk of receiving ddos attacks.

In order to avoid your slot being suspended or terminated, please make sure you ask us if you want to run an application on your slot.
