# Switching from other seedbox providers

If you are already with another seedbox provider, we will be more than happy to help you switch over to us and transfer your files over.

After you purchase your awesome seedbox from us, just open a support ticket from within your client area, providing us the connection details to your old seedbox and instruction on what files you need transfered and we will handle the data transfer for you.
