### Legacy vs Current: Which is Better?

The choice between legacy and current plans depends on your usage pattern:

- **Choose current plans** if you need more storage space and don't typically exceed the traffic quotas
- **Legacy plans were ideal** for users who needed unlimited traffic but could manage with less storage

:::note
If you're on a legacy plan and want to switch to a current plan (or vice versa), please contact support to discuss upgrade/downgrade options.
