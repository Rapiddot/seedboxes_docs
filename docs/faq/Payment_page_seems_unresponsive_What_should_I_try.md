# Payment page seems unresponsive. What should I try?
Sometimes the checkout page can appear to do nothing after you submit your payment details. This is usually caused by something in your browser environment blocking scripts from running or the page retrieving stale data from cache.

Try the following steps in order:

1. **Open the payment page in a private or incognito window.** This temporarily disables all extensions and uses a fresh cache for that session, which resolves the majority of stuck checkout issues.
2. **Temporarily disable browser extensions or add-ons.** Ad blockers, script blockers, password managers, and anti-tracking tools can interfere with the payment form. Disable them for the duration of the checkout and reload the page.
3. **Pause security suites or add the site to their allowlist.** Some antivirus, firewall, or privacy applications block payment scripts. Allowlist our domain or pause the protection briefly while you complete the payment, then re-enable it immediately afterward.
4. **Clear browser cache and cookies for our site.** Corrupted or stale cache entries can prevent the payment page from updating. Clear cache/cookies and reload.
5. **Try another browser or device.** A different browser profile or a mobile device can help confirm whether the issue is specific to one setup.

If the problem persists, contact support with details about your browser, device, any extensions or security software you use, and the exact time you attempted payment. We will investigate and help you complete your order.
