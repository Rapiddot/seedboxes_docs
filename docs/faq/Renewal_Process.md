# Renewal Process

10 days before your renewal due time, you will receive a new invoice for you to pay. The renewed service starts counting from the invoice due time, and not from the time you pay your invoice. So, if you pay your invoice 1 week before your account expires, you will not loose this 1 week.

On the next day after the due day, if your invoice is not paid, your account will be suspended and you will receive again a reminder email. We will send you reminders every 3 days after that. 20 days after your suspension, your account is terminated and deleted from our servers if not paid. You will not be able to restore your data after termination.

We encourage our clients, to send us a cancellation request from within their client area, letting us know that will not be renewing their service if they wish so. In this case your account will be terminated once expired, and you will not receive any payment reminder emails.

If you have a problem with your payment, and you require an extension of time, please let us know, and we will be happy to accommodate you.
