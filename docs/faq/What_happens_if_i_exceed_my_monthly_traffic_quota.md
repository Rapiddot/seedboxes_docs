# What happens if I exceed my monthly traffic quota?
Every server is connected to a 50 Gbit symmetrical dedicated uplink, so there is plenty of bandwidth available. To keep things fair across the fleet, each plan includes a monthly traffic quota that tracks only upload traffic from your seedbox. Download traffic always remains unmetered and unlimited.

## What the quota means
- The meter resets on your billing renewal date each month.
- Only data you UPLOAD from the seedbox (including all apps and ftp traffic) counts toward the quota.

## If you exceed the quota
If your upload usage surpasses the quota within a billing cycle, we temporarily limit your upload speed to 10 Mbit/sec for the rest of that cycle. Your seedbox continues operating normally at that rate, and once the quota resets at the start of the next cycle, your full upload speed returns automatically without any action on your part.
