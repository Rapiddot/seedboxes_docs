# If i switch torrent clients, do also torrents transfer from one client to the other ?

No, when switching torrent clients, the torrents are not transferred from one client to the other. You will have to re-import the torrents to the new client in order to resume seeding your torrents. Also if you switch back to the previous client, everything will be exactly as you left it while you were using it.

If you have not created custom folders for your torrents downloads and all your data are downloaded in the default downloads folder (~/files/downloads), it is possible to quickly import the torrents massively from one client to the other.

Just open a ticket requesting it, and we will do this for you
